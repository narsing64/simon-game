A web-based implementation of the classic Simon Game.

The Simon Game is a memory-based game where the player must follow a pattern of lights and sounds. Here's how to play:

Press the "Start" button to begin the game.
Pay attention to the pattern of lights and sounds played by the game.
Repeat the pattern by clicking on the colored buttons in the correct order.
Each time you correctly repeat the pattern, the game will add another step to the sequence.
If you make a mistake, the game will show the correct pattern and restart.
Try to beat your high score and challenge your memory skills!
The game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Feel free to customize the game by modifying the colors, sounds, or adding new features by editing the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

Enjoy playing the Simon Game!
